# OneMansLand
Space and plaanet exploration game for the Nintendo DS

# TODO

* [ ] Sprites
* [ ] Transition from space gameplay to planet gameplay

## Space-specific
* [x] Generating planets in space
* [x] Player
  * [x] Space-braking (change directions faster)
* [x] Other ships
* [x] Projectiles/weaponry system
* [ ] Starry background (parallax effect so we don't have to store that many squares since stars will be dynamically/randomly generated unless maybe not idk yet)
* [ ] Multiple weapons
  * Missle, laser, etc.
* [ ] Random spawning of enemies/groups of enemies AND friendlies
* [ ] Ship parts/upgrades
* [ ] Ship rubble (explorable wrecks? That use planetary top-down gameplay as well)

-- Later stage stuff --
* [ ] Radar on bottom screen with period update of other sips locations in radius
* [ ] Touchscreen slider (will look like a lever) for adjusting thrust power
* [ ] Indicators (health bar/weapon type/etc.)

## Exploration mode specfic

* [ ] Start
